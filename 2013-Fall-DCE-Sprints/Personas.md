## Chemistry and Computer Science Faculty

A chemistry faculty member is collaborating with a Computer Science professor to create a counterfeit drug detection program.
The program utilizes testing strips that change color when a drug compound is rubbed on it.
A tester in Kenya will perform a test, take a picture with their cell phone, and then send that picture to a Box.com folder for Notre Dame to run a color matching algorithm to detect any invalid compounds or proportions of compounds for a specified drug.
They would like to archive both the cell phone images and related tabular datasets in CurateND.
Each row in the dataset contains a column with IDs that correlate with an image.
Both people and software will need access to the images and data.
Most data and images should only be accessible to collaborators from Purdue, IU, a univeristy in Kenya, as well as other private citizens working for different government organizations.
The images would not be reused extensively.
Expect to have around 200 images next year, and around 900 the following at around 2-14 MB per size images coming from cell phones.
Records should be geocoded with coordinates.
Some data will need to be linked to publications with identifying information removed.
Data should be kept for 5 years, with some saved in perpetuity. Additionally, they may want to push data to Box in order to share.

## Biological Sciences Researcher

A biological sciences faculty member is collaborating with a professor at Tufts University to capture and analyze auditory calls and responses of amphibians.
They would like to archive and/or share the audio files and related datasets in CurateND and the Cornell Lab for Ornithology Repository (http://databib.org/repository/385).
Audio recordings are analyzed using a Java based Simulation Software.
There is typically a tabular dataset associated with each audio recording with 10,000 columns and rows that record parameters like environmental conditions.
They currently share and version files via Subversion and the software is on Sourceforge.
They are also interested in applying animal behavior specific ontology(s) to the records.

## Short Essay/Multimedia composition Journal Editor

Editors of an annual journal of selected best writing samples from first year students called Fresh Writing would like to convert their publication currently in print for the last 10 years to an online site as more work becomes "multimedia".
While work has been text only in the past, work now includes text, images, and video.
They would like to have materials preserved in CurateND and distributed through an online journal site with access to current material as well as materials from previous works.
They would also like to archive past print edition, but there may be copyright usage limitations as they are owned by the publisher.  Initially, a main page with the materials managed as a collection may be good enough. They would like the ability to create a vanity url for a collection however.  Then, the public face could be migrated to an independent site that is fed by content within the collection.  It would need to have different annual editions of content within the collection.  If content is in the IR as a collection, they would like to search just within the collection and sort a listing of materials just in the collection or search results.  As some past materials may have copyright issues they will need to grant access to some items to a list of users (ie a class), campus only access, and automatically expire access at the end of the semester.  Then, in the Spring they would like to have a website of content if possible.
There is a submission and review process in December of possible selections for publication in the journal.

## Applied and Computation Math and Statistics Professor

A faculty member in the Math department works on a collaborative software project with a former ND Ph.D., now at Clorado State U. (also courtesy Visiting Scholar position at ND), a former ND Ph.D., now at North Carolina State U. (also courtesy Visiting Scholar position at ND), and someone in General Motors R & D (also ca courtesy adjunct professor position at ND).
They would like to deposit and share and link articles, related datasets, the software, and the project website.
They also want to assign DOI's to any materials.
The faculty member also has a DARPA grant with data and software they want to archive as well.

## Art Historian

An art historian professor is nearing retirement and maintains a website in his personal space called "Career Alternatives for Art Historians" which he is hoping to move someplace like CurateND.
Many materials include position descriptions for positions at various universities, museums, and other organizations.
He may want to deposit visual materials as well.
He is an art historian who is interested in museums, and in Renaissance and Baroque art.
He also has an interest in the issue of public access to and the use of images for research, teaching and publication purposes.
More details TBD

## Visual Resources Center

The Visual Resources Center would like to archive and share upwards of 60,000 images mostly for campus through fair use.
There is exisiting metadata in dublin core currently within a Filemaker Pro Database.

## Psychology Professor

A psychology professor has articles and related data in the form of psychological tests and measures that they would like to archive and share.
Some materials may not be owned by the professor, but may want to link to items that are not owned.
 More details TBD.

## Business Professors

Two business professors are creating datasets of municipal bond data.
They have identified from previous research some sources of this data. One is Commercial and Financial Chronicle (HG 1 .C731 OVERSIZE). The Hesburgh library has V. 89 (1909) – V. 210 (1969) comprised of 175 pieces/volumes.
Hathi Trust also contains much of the digitized text to be mined for data.
They would like to archive and share this data in CurateND.

## Irish Studies Graduate Student

Two Irish Studies graduate students run an online journal called Breac.
They would like to archive current, previous versions of articles in the journal.

## Online Journal

The a center on campus publishes an online journal, and can see needing permanent web addresses and long-term discovery services.
Unclear yet on content in addition to text.
Meeting with them in mid-September.

## Latin American Politicial Science Journal

An institute has a series of publications from the early 1980's forward primarily focusing on political science and latin america.
David has the entire series on his shelf in simple stapled booklets.
There are also PDF's online that do not appear to have any OCR at the moment located at kellog.nd.edu->Research->Working Papers.
They could be interested in having website link to items in the repository instead and have cross-links from items that would appear in onesearch and curatend search.

## Film Television and Theatre Professor

Deposit faculty video and student content.
Share and stream video content.
More details TBD.

## General Researcher

Researcher has a project where they have datasets to share.
They want to create a research project profile, enter some description, and then tag incoming files with that description.
They want to link that project to either their Box account or file space to have CurateND watch a folder, that once files are dropped into get ingested into CurateND and linked/tagged to the research project.

## General Faculty

Faculty member wants to create a personal profile that lists all the publications, datasets, and other related work they have done.
They want to include both items they archive in CurateND, and items linked externally.
The faculty member wants metrics on how many times something has been viewed, downloaded, and cited.

## General Collection Manager

A Collection Manager has a set of materials they want to archive and share.
It is a combination of public domain, and under copyright material usable on campus via fair use.
They want to create a collection and make public domain items shared over open access, and share other items with campus only.

## Center for Social Research

The Center for Social Research supports faculty and researchers in social science.
They want features such as project spaces, internal and external collaboration, different levels of ownership and access, selective releasing of files, and versioning of released and un-released files.
 Here is a wish list:

* Easy to use: authors need not be concerned with issues of preservation or archiving
* Flexible and versatile: allow for varying levels of collaboration with anyone, anywhere
* Each project/study comprises a collection of files (including cataloging information, text files, data set files, graph files) and associated metadata
* Support common file types
* Allow embedding within the author’s web site
* Allow studies or collection of studies to be based on the same data files
* Adhere to metadata, conversion and preservation standards
* Data backup
  - Systematic and explicit duplication policies, Multiple mirroring of entire collections (rather than ad-hoc selections of individual items)
  - Regular (and documented) mirror updates of all versions.
* Automatically generate formal, persistent data citations
  - Automatically generate unique and consistent identifier for each resource (see http://www.doi.org/)
  - Generate persistent link (URL) and ID (see http://www.handle.net/)
  - Automatically manage identification of studies and/or datasets within studies
  - Calculate universal numerical fingerprints (UNF)
* Allow format conversion and fixity (automatically generate a checksum, message digest or digital signature as part of the ingest process)
* Reformat data files to a preservation format (a canonical format) independent of any specific software package
* Management and versioning
  - Allow authors to maintain different levels of ownership
  - Collaborators include a curator/admin and other contributors
  - Control over updates and support selective file releasing
  - Allow different levels of unrestricted and restricted access (e.g., public data, public study with terms of use, study with restricted file(s), restricted study)
  - Define Terms of Use and Permission
  - Support versioning of released and un-released files
  - Support de-accession
  - Automatically handle backups and recovery
  - Selectively duplication (e.g., to a new project)
* Provide search capabilities
* Data support:
  - Download in multiple formats
  - Download data subsets
  - Generate summary statistics (at least for tabular data)
  - Visualization (e.g., of time series)
