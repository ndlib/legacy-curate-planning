# IR Behaviors
This is an attempt at a behavioral taxonomy for Curate.
Items in bold are critical for a successful launch.

## Intake
- **Self-Deposit:** upload content via a web interface.
- Batch Ingest: programmatically load large quantities of data and metadata into the repository e.g. upload monographs digitized by the digital production unit.
- Automated Ingest: interface with 3rd-party storage providers and ingest content based upon criteria e.g. archive the contents of the "CurateND" subfolder in a [box](https://app.box.com) folder.

## Processing
- **Description:** web forms for enriching the metadata of an item.
- Mediation: items and changes to items can be passed through various approval queues.

## Publishing
- **Personal Profile:** present a curated list of the work of an individual.
- Dissemination: distribute derivatives of repository content.
- Syndication: provide embeddable views and or ATOM feeds of content to be displayed in another system.
  Expose metadata to enhance search engine integration e.g. schema.org microdata, Google Scholar.
- Exhibition: facilitating the creation of "learning experiences" showcasing the materials in the repository.

## Scholarship
- Citation: provide pre-formatted citations for content in various forms.
- Annotation: allow scholarly commentary to be applied to content, works, or collections.
- Arrangement: facilitate the grouping of works and content into arbitrary collections.
- Working Sets: data management needs for a research project are not the same as curating digitized humanities materials.
  We think that Projects can be an answer for this.

## Administration
- **Delegate Accounts:** allow users to act on behalf of other users.
- Identity Management: be able to connect other identity providers to the concept of "person" in Curate.
